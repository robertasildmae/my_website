This graph provides an overview of opinion polls for the 2021 German elections, looking at the 14-day rolling average % of support for each political party from January 2021 until now.

I will provide a short overview about how to clean, plot, analyse and infer results from the 2021 German elections dataframe.

To begin with, we first download the real-time data  on German election opinion polls from the respective Wikipedia page into R. This data contains several tables in a HTML format that need to be parsed into a separate dataframe  and listed using purr:map(). 

We specifically concentrate our analysis on one table that contains all opinion polls. In order to clean this data to a satisfactory format, we use the slice and mutate functions. This is done to eliminate unnecessary rows from the data and to convert dates into the right format for our analysis.

Next, we take this data and use the group_by and summarise function to calculate the mean scores for all German parties, looking at the 14-day rolling average percentage of support.

These results can be plotted using ggplot in R which allows us to create a scatterplot for each party, plotting the date on the x-axis and support percentage on the y-axis.

It is important to note that each political party needs be assigned it's respective colour and the plot must have a theme and correct labels and title. 

As a result of these steps, we are able to plot the 14-day rolling average % of support for each German political party from January 2021 until now, as R allows us to update our data in real-time.
