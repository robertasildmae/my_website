<p>This graph provides an overview of opinion polls for the 2021 German elections, looking at the 14-day rolling average % of support for each political party from January 2021 until now.</p>
<p>I will provide a short overview about how to clean, plot, analyse and infer results from the 2021 German elections dataframe.</p>
<p>To begin with, we first download the real-time data on German election opinion polls from the respective Wikipedia page into R. This data contains several tables in a HTML format that need to be parsed into a separate dataframe and listed using purr:map().</p>
<p>We specifically concentrate our analysis on one table that contains all opinion polls. In order to clean this data to a satisfactory format, we use the slice and mutate functions. This is done to eliminate unnecessary rows from the data and to convert dates into the right format for our analysis.</p>
<p>Next, we take this data and use the group_by and summarise function to calculate the mean scores for all German parties, looking at the 14-day rolling average percentage of support.</p>
<p>These results can be plotted using ggplot in R which allows us to create a scatterplot for each party, plotting the date on the x-axis and support percentage on the y-axis.</p>
<p>It is important to note that each political party needs be assigned itâ€™s respective colour and the plot must have a theme and correct labels and title.</p>
<p>As a result of these steps, we are able to plot the 14-day rolling average % of support for each German political party from January 2021 until now, as R allows us to update our data in real-time.</p>
